TestApp
=======

Just a simple Android TestApp.  Playing with HoloEverywhere and ABS.


###Importing the app in Eclipse:
- Install the EGit plugin in Eclipse
- `File` - `Import` - `Projects from Git` - `URI`
- Into the `Location - URI` enter: `git@github.com:AdamJB/TestApp.git` then click `Next`
- Check `Master` for the branch selection
- On the `Local Destination` window, make sure `Clone submodules` is checked, then click `Next`
- Select `Import existing projects` then click `Next`
- All projects except for the `HoloEverywhere Demo` projects are required and check `Search for nested projects`. Click `Finish`.
- Wait for the workspace to be built, it may take a while before all problems are resolved.
